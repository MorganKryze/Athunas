It may include a link to an important [reference](...).

### Setting up

#### Prerequisites

- Matrix led (price, link, etc.);
- Raspberry Pi zero
- Power supply
- SD card
- Raspberry pi imager
- Encoder
- ...

#### Install

First, follow the wiring instructions in the [wiring](./docs/wiring.md) guide.

[WIP]

Then, from on hand, you may install the project by running this command on the Raspberry Pi:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MorganKryze/Athunas/refs/heads/main/installation.sh | bash
```
