## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the following individuals for their contributions to the start of the project:

- [Allen's lab](https://github.com/allenslab): for the `matrix-dashboard` project, which is a great starting point for building a dashboard using the Matrix platform through his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5A6ET64Oz8).
- [Ty Porter](https://github.com/ty-porter): for bringing public [Allen's lab's project](https://github.com/ty-porter/matrix-dashboard) source code and making it available to the community.
- [Henner Zeller](https://github.com/hzeller): for the `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` library, which is the core of the communication between the Raspberry Pi and the led matrix.
- [Milk And Espresso](https://m.twitch.tv/milkandespresso/about): for making some of the original background images.

Finally, we would like to thank all the people who tried the project and gave us feedback to improve it.
