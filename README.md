## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the following individuals for their contributions to the start of the project:

- [Allen's lab](https://github.com/allenslab): for the `matrix-dashboard` project, which is a great starting point for building a dashboard using the Matrix platform through his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5A6ET64Oz8).
- [Ty Porter](https://github.com/ty-porter): for bringing public [Allen's lab's project](https://github.com/ty-porter/matrix-dashboard) source code and making it available to the community.
- [Henner Zeller](https://github.com/hzeller): for the `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` library, which is the core of the communication between the Raspberry Pi and the led matrix.
- [Milk And Espresso](https://m.twitch.tv/milkandespresso/about): for making some of the original background images.

Additionally, we would like to thank the following people for their contributions to the project:

- [Dimitry Siebert](https://github.com/foukouda): for bringing the project to life with his CAO expertise and PCB design skills.
- [Yann M. Vidamment](https://github.com/MorganKryze): for adapting Allen's lab project to our needs and vision regarding the software part of the project.

Finally, we would like to thank all the people who tried the project and gave us feedback to improve it.
