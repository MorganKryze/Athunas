# Configuration

> This guide will help you configure the project using a single configuration [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file. We will tackle all categories, but an example configuration is provided at the [end of this document](#example-configuration) and in the `config` folder of the repository at [`configs/example.config.yaml`](../configs/example.config.yaml).

## Important notes

<!-- TODO: Address and workflow liekly to change here. -->

The configuration file are NOT meant to be edited by hand. The recommended way to edit the configuration is to use the provided web editor running on the Raspberry Pi. You can access it by navigating to `http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:9000` in your web browser.

If you may confider editing the configuration manually, please be aware of the following:

- The configuration file is written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format, which is a human-readable data serialization standard. Not properly formatting the file will lead to errors when loading the configuration and flagging the file as broken making it unusable.
- The configuration file is divided into sections, each section containing specific configuration options. Each section will be explained in detail below.
- The project uses a single configuration file to manage all aspects of the system, including system configuration, module configuration, and application configuration.
- The configuration file is located in the `configs/generations/` folder of the repository and is named following the pattern `generation_<id>.yaml`, where `<id>` is the generation number.
- Broken configurations files follow the naming pattern `generation_<id>.broken.yaml`. These files are created when the configuration file is not valid and cannot be loaded by the system or has produced a critical error during the runtime. These files will be ignored when the system will try to load the latest configuration.
- When using the web editor and saving the new configuration, the system will automatically create a new generation of the configuration file, incrementing the generation number. The previous generation will remain unaltered.

## Variables

### Metadata

> `Metadata` is used to store information about the configuration file, these settings will not alter how the project works, but help the program to choose which file to load and provide information about the configuration file itself.

- `id` (integer, ex: `2`): The unique identifier of the configuration file. This is used to differentiate between different generations of the configuration file. The `example.config.yaml` file has an `id` of `0`, the first generation will have an `id` of `1`, and so on.
- `version` (string, ex: `1.6.3`): The version of the project, saved in the configuration file in the moment of the generation.
- `created_at` (string, ex: `2025-01-01 12:00`): The date and time when the configuration file was created.
- `origin` (string, values: `default`, `user`): The origin of the configuration file. This can be `default` if the file is the original template provided by the project, or `user` if the file has been modified by the user.
- `is_broken` (boolean, ex: `false`): A flag indicating whether the configuration is broken or not. If the file is broken, it will not be loaded by the system.
- `broken_reason` (string, ex: `Invalid syntax`): A description of the reason why the configuration is broken. This will be set to `None` if the file is

### System

  - `gpio_sw` (integer, ex: `13`): The GPIO pin number used for the switch signal of the rotary encoder.

### Modules

> `Modules` are the toolboxes used by applications. They provide additional functionality to the applications and can be enabled or disabled based on the user's needs. Disabled modules will result in the corresponding applications not being available and disabled.

Each module is defined as an object with the following common metadata:

- `name` (string, ex: `Notifications`): The name of the module.
- `description` (string, ex: `Provides notification services to applications.`): A brief description of the module's functionality.

Each module can have additional configuration options specific to its functionality.

- `Notifications` (object): Provides notification services to applications.
  - `app_white_list` (list of strings, ex: `["MainScreen", "Pomodoro"]`): A list of applications that are allowed to use this module.
  - `websocket_url` (string, ex: `ws://localhost:9000`): The URL of the WebSocket server used by the module.
  - `retry_delay_on_error` (integer, ex: `1000`): The delay in milliseconds before retrying an operation after an error.
- `Weather` (object): Provides weather information to applications.
  - `token` (string, ex: `your_api_token`): The API token for accessing weather data.
  - `latitude` (float, ex: `37.7749`): The latitude of the location for which weather data is requested.
  - `longitude` (float, ex: `-122.4194`): The longitude of the location for which weather data is requested.
  - `temperature_unit` (string, values: `celcius`, `fahrenheit`): The unit of temperature to be used in the weather data.
- `Spotify` (object): Provides Spotify integration to applications.
  - `client_id` (string, ex: `your_spotify_client_id`): The client ID for the Spotify API.
  - `client_secret` (string, ex: `your_spotify_client_secret`): The client secret for the Spotify API.
  - `redirect_uri` (string, ex: `http://localhost:9000/callback`): The redirect URI for the Spotify API authentication.

### Apps

> `Apps` are the applications that are available to the user. Each app can provide horizontal and/or vertical content, and can be configured to replace other apps in the same orientation. Disabled apps will not be available to the user.
> Also note that only apps that provide horizontal content will be shown in the app carousel. An app that onlu provides vertical content will only shown on screen if selected as a replacement app for another app that provides horizontal content.

Each app is defined as an object with the following common metadata:

- `enabled` (boolean, ex: `true`): Whether the app is enabled or not. Disabled apps will not be available to the user and will not be loaded by the system.
- `name` (string, ex: `Main Screen`): The name of the app.

- `provides_horizontal_content` (boolean, ex: `true`): Whether the app provides horizontal content or not. Apps that provide horizontal content will be shown in the app carousel.
- `provides_vertical_content` (boolean, ex: `false`): Whether the app provides vertical content or not.

Metadata is not intended to be edited by the user, but is provided for informational purposes on the webui platform for instance.

All apps share the following common configuration options:

- `horizontal_replacement_app` (string, ex: `None`): The app that will replace this app when it is displayed in horizontal orientation. If set to `None`, the app will not be replaced.
- `vertical_replacement_app` (string, ex: `Pomodoro`): The app that will replace this app when it is displayed in vertical orientation. If set to `None`, the app will not be replaced.
- `dependencies` (list of strings): A list of module names that this app depends on. If the required modules are not enabled, the app will not be available to the user.

Each app can have additional configuration options specific to its functionality, as well as a list of dependencies on modules.
